What is isset()?
    * The isset() function in PHP is used to check if a variable is set and not null.

<?php
$name = "Alice";
$age = null;

if (isset($name)) {
    echo "The variable 'name' is set.<br>";
}

if (isset($age)) {
    echo "The variable 'age' is set.<br>";
} else {
    echo "The variable 'age' is NOT set or is NULL.<br>";
}

if (isset($email)) {
    echo "The variable 'email' is set.<br>";
} else {
    echo "The variable 'email' is NOT set.<br>";
}
?>

OUTPUT:

The variable 'name' is set.
The variable 'age' is NOT set or is NULL.
The variable 'email' is NOT set.
