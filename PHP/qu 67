67. Construct a program that tokenizes a sentence into words using regular expressions. Then, count the number of occurrences of each word and display the results.
 <?php
$sentence = "PHP is great and PHP is powerful";
// Tokenize using regex (split by non-letters)
$words = preg_split("/\W+/", strtolower($sentence), -1, PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY);
// Count occurrences
$counts = array_count_values($words);
// Display result
foreach ($counts as $word => $count) {
    echo "$word : $count <br>";
}
?>
Output:
php : 2
is : 2
great : 1
and : 1
powerful : 1
