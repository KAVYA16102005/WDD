39. A school wants to automate the calculation of student grades. Design a system that allows teachers to input student scores, calculates their grades, and generates a summary report. How would you utilize arrays and array functions to store and process the student data effectively?
<?php
// Step 1: Store student scores in an array
$students = array(
    "Alice" => 85,
    "Bob"   => 72,
    "Clara" => 91,
    "David" => 60
);
// Step 2: Function to calculate grade
function getGrade($score) {
    if ($score >= 90) return "A";
    elseif ($score >= 75) return "B";
    elseif ($score >= 60) return "C";
    else return "D";
}
// Step 3: Process each student and store grades
$report = array();
foreach ($students as $name => $score) {
    $report[$name] = array(
        "Score" => $score,
        "Grade" => getGrade($score)
    );
}
// Step 4: Generate summary report
echo "<h3>Student Grade Report</h3>";
foreach ($report as $name => $data) {
    echo "$name - Score: {$data['Score']}, Grade: {$data['Grade']} <br>";
}
?>
Output:
Student Grade Report
Alice - Score: 85, Grade: B
Bob - Score: 72, Grade: C
Clara - Score: 91, Grade: A
David - Score: 60, Grade: C
