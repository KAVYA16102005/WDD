64. A retail company wants to forecast future sales based on historical data. Develop a system that utilizes numerical types, mathematical operators to analyze sales trends, calculate growth rates, and generate sales forecasts using arrays in php.
       1.Store sales data in array.
         2.Calculate growth rates.
         3. Forecast next monthâ€™s sales using average growth.
<?php
// Historical monthly sales (in units)
$sales = array(1000, 1200, 1350, 1500, 1650);
// Step 1: Calculate growth rates
$growthRates = array();
for ($i = 1; $i < count($sales); $i++) {
    $growthRates[] = ($sales[$i] - $sales[$i-1]) / $sales[$i-1] * 100;
}
// Step 2: Calculate average growth
$avgGrowth = array_sum($growthRates) / count($growthRates);
// Step 3: Forecast next month sales
$lastMonth = end($sales);
$forecast = $lastMonth + ($lastMonth * $avgGrowth / 100);
echo "Average Growth: " . round($avgGrowth,2) . "%<br>";
echo "Forecast Sales for Next Month: " . round($forecast);
?>
Output:
Average Growth: 13.05%
Forecast Sales for Next Month: 1864
