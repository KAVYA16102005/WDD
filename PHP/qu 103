103. Create a very simple pageview counter by using ‘isset’ to check if the pageview variable has already been created.
<?php
session_start();
if (!isset($_SESSION['pageviews'])) {
    $_SESSION['pageviews'] = 1;
} else {
    $_SESSION['pageviews']++;
}
echo "This page has been viewed " . $_SESSION['pageviews'] . " times.";
?>
