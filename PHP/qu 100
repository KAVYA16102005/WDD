100. Using PHP, construct a program to restrict the user from uploading the same file again and again. If the same file already exists in that folder, display an appropriate error message.
<?php
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == "POST") {
    $target = "uploads/" . basename($_FILES["file"]["name"]);
    if (file_exists($target)) {
        echo "Error: This file already exists. Upload denied.";
    } else {
        move_uploaded_file($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"], $target);
        echo "File uploaded successfully!";
    }
}
?>
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    Select file: <input type="file" name="file">
    <input type="submit" value="Upload">
</form>
