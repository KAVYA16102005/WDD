* The substr() function extracts a substring from a string.

* Here, the first argument is 12345, an integer, but PHP automatically converts it to the string "12345" because substr() requires a string.

* substr("12345", 2, 2) means:

* Start at index 2 (0-based indexing), which is the character '3'.

* Extract 2 characters starting from there â†’ "34".

* So, $sub will be "34".

* The output of the code will be:

* sub is 34

* Although it works, it's better to explicitly convert the number to a string for clarity, like:
  $sub = substr(strval(12345), 2, 2);

* This avoids confusion and improves code readability.
