91. Recognize how sessions are stored in PHP?
•	By default, PHP stores sessions on the server-side as temporary files.
•	Each session has a unique session ID (sent to the client via cookie PHPSESSID).
•	On Linux, session files are usually stored in /tmp.
•	You can configure session storage using php.ini (session.save_path).
