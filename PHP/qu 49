49. A sports team wants to evaluate player performance based on various statistical metrics. Design a system that utilizes numerical types and mathematical operators to calculate performance indices, averages, and rankings. How would you handle large datasets and perform complex calculations efficiently?
<?php
// Player stats: Name => [Points, Assists, Matches]
$players = array(
    "Alice" => array("points"=>120, "assists"=>45, "matches"=>10),
    "Bob"   => array("points"=>90, "assists"=>30, "matches"=>12),
    "Clara" => array("points"=>150, "assists"=>50, "matches"=>15)
);
// Calculate performance index = (points + assists) / matches
$performance = array();
foreach ($players as $name => $stats) {
    $performance[$name] = ($stats["points"] + $stats["assists"]) / $stats["matches"];
}
// Sort players by performance index (ranking)
arsort($performance);
echo "<h3>Player Rankings</h3>";
foreach ($performance as $name => $index) {
    echo "$name - Performance Index: " . round($index,2) . "<br>";
}
?>
Output:
Player Rankings
Alice - Performance Index: 16.5
Clara - Performance Index: 13.33
Bob - Performance Index: 10
